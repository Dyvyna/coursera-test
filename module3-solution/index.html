At the same time, cut back on less healthy choices, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices and refined grains.

                    An omnivorous diet includes both plant and animal foods. It's the most common diet among humans, and many other animals are omnivores as well, including many bears, birds, and other small mammals. However, a balanced omnivorous diet provides all necessary nutrients and contributes to health.
