			Vegetarian
		</div>
		<p>
			To get the most out of a vegetarian diet, choose a variety of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains. At the same time, cut back on less healthy choices, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices and refined grains.

			Omnivore
		</div>
		<p>
			An omnivorous diet includes both plant and animal foods. It's the most common diet among humans, and many other animals are omnivores as well, including many bears, birds, and other small mammals. However, a balanced omnivorous diet provides all necessary nutrients and contributes to health.

		<p>
			When planning your meals, include green leafy veg (kale, spinach, spring greens, watercress, rocket, pak choi) in them each day. Choose plant milk, cereal, spread and soya yoghurt that are fortified with vitamin B12, calcium and, where possible, vitamin D (making sure the latter is not animal-based).
